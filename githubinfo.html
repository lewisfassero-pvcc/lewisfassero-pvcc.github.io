				<b><span style="color: #e18b8a;">A.</span></b> According to <a href="https://nira.com/github-history/" target="_blank">Nira</a>, "When Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett got together in 2008 to collaborate on a project, the three friends fully intended for their side hustle to be just that—a weekend project, and nothing more. But it didn’t take long for them to realize that their idea was potentially much bigger than they’d realized. Their idea would become far more than a weekend project: It would transform how people write and share code."</td></tr>
			<tr><td colspan="2"><b><span style="color: #e18b8a;">Q.</span></b> What company owns GitHub now?<br />

			<tr><td colspan="2"><b><span style="color: #e18b8a;">Q.</span></b> How much does a GitHub account cost?<br />
				<b><span style="color: #e18b8a;">A.</span></b> Currently, GitHub offers free accounts for individuals and organizations, but they have some limitations, so many people opt for an upgraded "Teams" account, which costs $4/month. For those who need the most extensive features, Github also offers a top-tier "Enterprise" account, which is better suited for larger organizations and costs $21/month.</td></tr>

		<h2>Git/GitHub Terms</h2>
		<h4><i>(Definitions sourced from <a href="https://docs.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Docs</a>.)</i></h4>
	
		<table style="width:100%; border:0px">
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">repository</span></b>: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.</td></tr>
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">commit</span></b>: Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch.</td></tr>
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">fork</span></b>: A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.</td></tr>
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">push</span></b>: Use "git push" to push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository.</td></tr>
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">pull requests</span></b>: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.</td></tr>
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">workflows</span></b>: A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.</td></tr>
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">issues</span></b>: Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work.</td></tr>
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">raw button</span></b>: With the raw view, you can view or copy the raw content of a file without any styling.</td></tr>
			<tr><td><b><span style="color: #8ec9ff;">blame button</span></b>: Within the blame view, you can view the line-by-line revision history for an entire file.</td></tr>
